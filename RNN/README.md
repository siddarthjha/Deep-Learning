# Recurrence Neural Network:
* It is similar to a normal Neural network with tiny changes.

* Here we add **Recurrence** functionality to a Neural network along with **Back Propogation**.

* The output is feeded internally from one step to another step.
* The loses are all **Back Propogated** to the beginning.
* This type of Neural Networks are used when the maintaing the sequence of data is required
###### Example:
For prediction of words in a sentence like

1. Sun rises from ______.
2. An ______ a day keeps a doctor away.
